We're aware that the terms of service that apply to apps distributed via Apple's App Store services may conflict with rights granted under our license, the GNU Affero Public License version 3.0. 
The copyright holders do not wish this conflict to prevent the otherwise-compliant distribution of derived apps via the App Store.
Therefore, we have committed not to pursue any license violation that results solely from the conflict between the GNU AGPLv3 and the Apple App Store terms of service.
In other words, as long as you comply with the AGPL in all other respects, including its requirements to provide users with source code and the text of the license, we will not object to any distribution of this app or derived apps through the App Store.
